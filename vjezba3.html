        <h1 style="color: seagreen;">2025 BMW M4</h1>
        <h2 style="color: blueviolet;">Overview</h2>
        <p>The 2025 BMW M4 high-performance coupe is all business: Dense, muscular bodywork haunches down over massive tires, an exaggerated but functional front aerodynamic appliance manages airflow, and a quartet of exhaust pipes announce the arrival of its twin-turbo inline-six engine with blaring intensity. Like the M3 sedan that it shares much of its structural and spiritual DNA with, the M4 benefits from the automaker's M performance division's work on its engine and chassis. The base M4 comes equipped with a 473-hp twin-turbo inline-six mated with a six-speed manual gearbox and rear drive—the time-honored configuration for maximum driver involvement, and BMW's decision to keep it on the books speaks volumes.The Competition trim forgoes the manual for an eight-speed automatic, but bumps output to 503 horsepower. All-wheel drive is available on the Competition and, for the 2025 model year, selecting AWD comes with a value-added bonus in the form of an additional 20 horsepower for a total of 523 ponies.</p>

        <p> For maximum performance, consider the CS model, which comes with a 543-hp variant of the engine. The M4's suspension is tuned for performance, and it'll reward you with stupendous levels of grip on twisty backroads and track days; just know that every pothole and road imperfection will remind you of just how taught that suspension is. That—and the overly complex configurable drive modes—are two important characteristics that we think are handled with more finesse in competitors like the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing, Mercedes-AMG C63 and Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. </p>
